# Neural Network Implementation from Scratch

This repository showcases a from-scratch implementation of a neural network using pure Python. The project is designed to peel back the layers of abstraction found in high-level deep learning frameworks, providing an intuitive exploration into the workings of neural networks. The implementation covers the core components of a neural network, including forward propagation, backward propagation, and the optimization process.

## Project Overview

The neural network was developed to understand the underpinnings of machine learning algorithms by manually coding the processes involved in training a neural model. Through this hands-on approach, the project aims to provide insights into the inner mechanics of neural networks, which are often obscured by the convenience of deep learning libraries.

Key achievements of this project include:
- Implementing a complete neural network architecture from scratch.
- Crafting forward and backward propagation algorithms manually.
- Achieving accuracy on par with a PyTorch implementation on a color classification dataset.
